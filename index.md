# Vibhasri's First CS193 Homework

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

### My Favorite Things About CS 193
- We are exposed to programming and computer science tools (I know it's like I tried to play with the word but I actually didn't, I couldn't think of a better phrase) that we will probably use a lot in our future with computer science
- We learn skills that I feel like most people/universities/teachers expect us to learn on our own
- It's taught by TAs which is amazing because it's actually engaging (especially y'all!)
- The weird, random comments on the slides and the magic word that makes you actually remember that there are weird, random, fun things in life
